	<p style="font-family: verdana;font-size: 20px;color:black;">All vocabulary is useful for IELTS as the test is essentially just testing your English skills, so don't get too focused on specific words that you may need for the test.
<br><br>
However, there are certain topics that come up in the test so it's useful to know different words and phrases connected to them so you can potentially demonstrate a wide range of vocabulary and express yourself in the best way possible.<br><br>

They could be useful for all modules of the test.<br><br>

You could get these kinds of topics in your speaking test in Section Three and you may get an essay topic related to them.<br><br>

And of course it helps with your reading to know as many words as possible as they are very complex, and with the final sections of the listening test, which again are likely to have higher level vocabulary.<br> </p>
