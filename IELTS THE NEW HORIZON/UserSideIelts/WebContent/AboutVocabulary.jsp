			<p class="vocab_text">
				This IELTS Topic Related Vocabulary will help you to learn useful
				words and phrases that may come up in the IELTS test or that can be
				used in essays or speaking. <br>
				<br> Each IELTS vocabulary list consists of: <br>
				<br> <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" style="color: blue">&nbsp;The
					Word</i><br> <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right" style="color: blue">&nbsp;The
					Definition</i><br> <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"
					style="color: blue">&nbsp;An Example Sentence</i><br>

<br>
<br>All vocabulary is useful for IELTS as the test is essentially just testing your English skills, so don't get too focused on specific words that you may need for the test. 


<br>
<br>However, there are certain topics that come up in the test so it's useful to know different words and phrases connected to them so you can potentially demonstrate a wide range of vocabulary and express yourself in the best way possible.


<br>
<br>They could be useful for all modules of the test.


<br>
<br>You could get these kinds of topics in your speaking test in Section Three and you may get an essay topic related to them.


<br>
<br>And of course it helps with your reading to know as many words as possible as they are very complex, and with the final sections of the listening test, which again are likely to have higher level vocabulary

            Read as much as possible. If you come across a word you don't know, write it down or look it up.<br><br>

Use a dictionary. Many browsers include dictionaries. If you are reading online, you may be able to right-click on a word to look it up.<br><br>

Sign up for a 'word a day' email.<br><br>

Think of ways of remembering words. Do they sound like a word in your own language?<br><br>

Remember words are often used together with other words. Try to learn these 'collocations'
