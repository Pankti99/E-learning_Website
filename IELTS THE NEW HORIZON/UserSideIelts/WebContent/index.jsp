      	<h3>Test format &ndash; Listening</h3>
<p>
<strong>30 minutes</strong><br>
<br>
You will listen to four recordings of native English speakers and then write your answers to a series of questions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Recording 1 &ndash; a conversation between two people set in an everyday social context.</li>
    <li>Recording 2 - a monologue set in an everyday social context, e.g. a speech about local facilities.</li>
    <li>Recording 3 &ndash; a conversation between up to four people set in an educational or training context, e.g. a university tutor and a student discussing an assignment.</li>
    <li>Recording 4 - a monologue on an academic subject, e.g. a university lecture.</li>
</ul>
Assessors will be looking for evidence of your ability to understand the main ideas and detailed factual information, the opinions and attitudes of speakers, the purpose of an utterance and evidence of your ability to follow the development of ideas.

            <p>The first two sections deal with situations set in everyday social contexts. In Section 1, there is a conversation between two speakers (for example, a conversation about travel arrangements), and in Section 2, there is a monologue in (for example, a speech about local facilities). The final two sections deal with situations set in educational and training contexts. In Section 3, there is a conversation between two main speakers (for example, two university students in discussion, perhaps guided by a tutor), and in Section 4, there is a monologue on an academic subject. </p>
            <p>The recordings are heard only once. They include a range of accents, including British, Australian, New Zealand, American and Canadian.</p>

            <p>Test takers are required to locate specific information within the lettered paragraphs/sections of a text, and to write the letters of the correct paragraphs/sections in the boxes on their answer sheet. </p>
            <p>They may be asked to find: specific details, an example, a reason, a description, a comparison, a summary, an explanation. They will not necessarily need to find information in every paragraph/section of the text, but there may be more than one piece of information that test takers need to locate in a given paragraph/section. When this is the case, they will be told that they can use any letter more than once. </p>
            <p>This type of task can be used with any text as it tests a wide range of reading skills, from locating detail to recognising a summary or definition.</p>

      	<h3>Test format &ndash; Writing</h3>
<p>
<strong>60 minutes</strong><br>
<br>
Topics are of general interest to, and suitable for, test takers entering undergraduate and postgraduate studies or seeking professional registration. There are two tasks:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Task 1 </strong>- you will be presented with a graph, table, chart or diagram and asked to describe, summarise or explain the information in your own words. You may be asked to describe and explain data, describe the stages of a process, how something works or describe an object or event.</li>
    <li><strong>Task 2</strong> - you will be asked to write an essay in response to a point of view, argument or problem. Responses to both tasks must be in a formal style.&nbsp;</li>

They should write in an academic or semi-formal/neutral styles and include the most important and the most relevant points in the diagram. Some minor points or details may be left out.</p>

The speaking component assesses your use of spoken English. Every test is recorded.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Part 1</strong> - the examiner will ask you general questions about yourself and a range of familiar topics, such as home, family, work, studies and interests. This part lasts between four and five minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Part 2</strong>&nbsp; - you will be given a card which asks you to talk about a particular topic. You will have one minute to prepare before speaking for up to two minutes. The examiner will then ask one or two questions on the same topic.</li>
    <li><strong>Part 3</strong> - you will be asked further questions about the topic in Part 2. These will give you the opportunity to discuss more abstract ideas and issues. This part of the test lasts between four and five minutes.

            <p>Part 2 is the individual long turn. The examiner gives the test takers a task card which asks the test takers to talk about a particular topic, includes points to cover in their talk and instructs the test takers to explain one aspect of the topic. Test takers are given one minute to prepare their talk, and are given a pencil and paper to make notes. The examiner asks the test takers to talk for 1 to 2 minutes, stops the test takers after 2 minutes, and asks one or two questions on the same topic.</p>
            <p>Using the points on the task card effectively, and making notes during the preparation time, will help the test takers think of appropriate things to say, structure their talk, and keep talking for 2 minutes.</p>
            <p>Part 2 lasts 3&ndash;4 minutes, including the preparation time.</p>
